Saco

1. High Concept

Saco seeks to combine the relaxing fishing atmosphere from games like Animal Crossing and combine it with the mechanical fishing complexities of Sega Bass fishing. Saco is a fishing simulation game that aims to be both fun and relaxing.

2. Genre

Fishing Simulation 

3. Platform

Desktop

4. Story

The player controls Demetri, a half-fish, half-human fisherman living in Saco, Maine. Demetri is going to have a nice relaxing fishing day. As Demetri (The Player) catches fish, the fish will tell him something before he releases them! It can be anything from a joke, a small story, trivia, etc. The game is very simple and the player does not have much more to accomplish other than trying to catch fish.

5. Aesthetics

The Graphical style will be hand drawn, cartoony graphics, with a rich color scheme. The sound of the game will be ambient soft jazz. The Game will have sound effects for equipping fishing lures and bait, casting the rod, reeling in and splashes for when the fish is caught. Also some general talking noise for the characters to make while their text-speech comes out. There would also be some atmospheric sounds (water running, wind blowing, etc) for while the player is waiting for a fish to bite.

6. Gameplay

Mechanics: The player has to chose whether to use a fishing lure or bait. If the player uses the lure instead of the bait, they will click the water to cast their rod. Then they will repeatadly click to reel the rod back in. The player may or may not get a bite while the rod is being reeled in. If they do, the word "BITE!" will apear on the screen and the player will be instructed to rappidly and repeatedly click in order to reel the fish in. If the player chose bait instead, they will first have to chose what kind of bait to use. Then they will cast out their rod, but instead of reeling it back in while waiting for a bite, the player will just sit and wait. Once they do get a bite, it will be the same as reeling a fish in with lure. If the player does not reel in fast enough, the fish will be cause. If the player does catch the fish, the fish will talk to the player briefly and then let back into sea. There will be a counter int the corner of the screen that keeps count of how many fish you catch in one sitting. In order to catch the most fish, the player will have to experiment with what works better for catching fish on any given day. Using a lure will produce different results than bait, and bait will work differently depending on what type of bait you use. Different equipment will randomly work better randomly, using the date as a seed for randomization.
Control: All of the controls use the mouse. Chosing what to equip on your fishing rod will be done with the mouse. The mouse will also be used to cast the rod as well as reeling it back in.
Teaching the Game: If it is the player's first time playing the game, little message bubbles will apear breifly explaining the game's mechanics. These message bubbles will not slow down the game at all, they will just be supplemental visuals to help confused players.
Player Learning: In order to catch some of the rarer fish, players will need to have high fish-caught counters and low times. To do this, the player will have to experiment with what equipment works best on their fishing rod that day and learn to use the right equipment.

Additional mechanics may be added later like a tide-changing function that would make what equipment is most effective for fishing change as the tide does. This would mean players might have to mix up their equipment strategies while fishing.
